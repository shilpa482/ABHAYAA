        <h1>Women Disease</h1>
        <p><h2>Importance to spread Awareness abount diseases :</h2></p>
            <p style="color: aliceblue;">Both men and women fall prey to similar health conditions. But in most cases, most health problems in women go unnoticed, increasing the chances of life-threatening diseases and health conditions in women. A woman’s body changes once they hit puberty, become pregnant, during pre-menopause, and menopause. In this race of managing a successful professional life, health takes a backseat in most cases, leading to health repercussions. Therefore, we are trying to create awareness about womens health from our Womens Health section. To keep you abreast about all significant women-related health problems, we bring some well-researched articles by experienced medical practitioners and contributors. This section talks about the essential aspects of women’s health by focusing on the many health diseases and conditions prevalent in women. You can learn about various issues related to womens health in this section. Read about various health topics including menstruation, pregnancy, cholesterol, heart health, osteoporosis, diabetes, etc., which are now a common syndrome in women.</p>

                    <h2>Thyroid in Women</h2>
                    <p>Thyroid has become a significant health problem in women. Hormone imbalances also occur with weight gain in the thyroid. According to one study, women have ten times more thyroid than men. The main reason for this is the high prevalence of autoimmune problems in women. According to an SRL Diagnostics report, 20 per cent of women were found positive for thyroid antibodies, compared to 15 per cent of men. 18 per cent of the population aged 31 to 45 have been found positive for thyroid antibodies. The largest number of people in northern India is positive for thyroid antibodies. The thyroid disorder affects the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped organ located in the front of the neck below Adams apple. Hormones produced and stored by the thyroid gland affect the functioning of various body parts. These hormones regulate the bodys metabolic rate, heart and digestive systems functioning, brain development, control of muscles, bones, and mood maintenance.</p>
                    <h2>Iron-Deficiency In Women</h2>
<p>Dr Rajul Tyagi Gynaecologist & Obstetrician Doctors say that "the next set of symptoms I regularly see is chronic headache, dizziness, or lightheadedness. When all these symptoms are found in a cluster, the first step is to take the Hemoglobin (Hb) test to ascertain haemoglobin levels. When it corroborates with the symptoms, a differential diagnosis of anaemia can be made.</p>

                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12">
                    <h2>Breast Cancer in Women</h2>
                    <p>In most cases, breast cancer cells form a tumour that can often be felt as a lump or seen on an X-ray. Breast cancer is not only growing at a rapid pace but has also overtaken all other cancers to emerge as the most common cancer among women. It occurs almost in women, but men can also get breast cancer in rare cases. It is necessary to be aware of the fact that most breast lumps are not cancerous. Non-cancerous breast tumours are just abnormal growths that do not spread outside the breast. Although non-cancerous tumours are not life-threatening, some types of women may have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. If a breast lump is felt, it is imperative to have it checked by a certified physician to determine whether it is benign or malignant and whether it may affect your future cancer risk. Besides, awareness and regular screening of symptoms are essential ways to reduce risk. With rapidly increasing disease incidence, particularly among women under 50 years of age, women need to step up surveillance and screenings.</p>
                    <h2>Osteoporosis in Women</h2>
<p>Women with perimenopause have a 56% increased risk of osteoporosis in their 70s. Early menopause is a springboard for many health conditions in women, and osteoporosis is one of them. Mostly all women experience a drop in bone density when they go through menopause. But women in early menopause have more chances of weak and brittle bones than their female counterparts, who have a late menopause.</p>

                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12">
                   <h2> Cervical Cancer in Women</h2>
<p>Cervical cancer is the most common cause of death of women worldwide. Do you know that this cancer is becoming common in Indian women as well? Yes, if you look at the statistics, this cancer is becoming the second largest cause of death among women due to lack of timely treatment. But it is a cancerous disease that can be avoided or cured at the right time. Every year, there are approximately 1,22,000 new cancer cases in India, of which around 67,500 are women. Cervical cancer is the cause of 11.1 per cent of all cancer-related deaths. This situation gets worse because only 3.1 per cent of the women in the country are screened for this condition, due to which the remaining women live under the shadow of danger.</p>
<h2>Women's Health And Breastfeeding</h2>
<p>Consuming a healthy diet with enough calcium and vitamin D makes no need to take vitamin supplements while breastfeeding. However, it is recommended to discuss with your doctor before starting or stopping any medicines or supplements. Breastfeeding has advantages for both mom and baby, and the decision to breast-feed is very personal. It is essential to discuss the issues related to breastfeeding and pregnancy-associated osteoporosis with the expert.</p>
