                <p>"नारी" - Our tomorrow,eye of our nation and perfect architect of the society only if women's are empowered .Nowadays, women empowerment is needed more than ever . There are various reasons for this. Firstly, women in India are in danger of honor killings. Their family thinks its right to take their lives if they bring shame to the reputation of their legacy. Empowerment is giving legitimate power to women. If women were empowered they would be able to participate in the planning and decision making task and contribute to the development programmes and activities individually. Women should realize that they have constitutional rights to quality health care, economic security, and access to education and political power. Empowerment of women is an effective solution that would help them to be ‘self reliant’ with a position to enable them to face any difficult situation. It is not just economical in essence but an intellectual enlightenment leading to the social empowerment of women think Social help groups would enable them to lead a life of dignity, respect,employment generation and make informed decisions, as he stressed on the need to build coalitions against gender discrimination..The atrocities against the women can be brought to an end with the help of our self help group named as "अभया - Let's Make The नारी Fearless".</p>

                <p>Here We are trying to make women strong and healthy so that she will not depend on other to fight for her. basically we are serving a platform for the safety and empowerment of women which will help them to get help and sessions for understanding the rights given by our constitution.We are providing free guidance, free and paid workshops and self-defense seminars in different parts of the country . We are also trying to help to the poor and socially and economically backward women's by raising funds for them and infinitely giving guidance and moral support. we believe that “Communities and countries and ultimately the world are only as strong as the health of their women" therefore by conducting session for women's to take responsibility not only of her family but also  her health and  identify services, thereby increasing equal access to services, resources, and products that best help them prevent and reduce poor health are indeed necessary . A strong woman is one who feels deeply and loves fiercely. Her tears flow as abundantly as her laughter therefore by praising superwomen will definitely help others to motivate.अभया want every women as a shadow of दुर्गा who will lift and build others, who will love and be loved, women who live bravely, both tender and fierce, women of indomitable will.And one day अभया will discover the day when every women will know that she was fierce, and strong, and full of fire, and that not even she could hold herself back </p>
