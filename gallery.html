        <h2>Self-Defense Techniques That Could Save Your Life</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12">
                    
                    <p>
                        During times of crisis such as natural disasters, riots, terrorist attacks, etc. when there’s a lot of confusion and panic, it’s almost inevitable to see a rise in crime. There will be an increase in murders, rapes, looting incidents, muggings and much more.
Criminals grab the opportunity when things are chaotic to commit crimes hoping they can get away with it.. Most people have no idea what to expect and just can’t fathom the level of violence that could arise in a hostile situation. They panic, make the wrong moves and either end up hurt or losing their life.
In this article, you’ll be shown a few moves that are simple but so devastatingly effective that even one of them applied effectively can bring your opponent to his knees in pain.
These moves are not pretty and are banned in almost all fighting sports. If you thought mixed martial arts was brutal, you have not seen what real self-defense moves are.
In a self-defense situation, you never want to go to the ground and grapple. The goal of all self-defense should be to run off the first chance to get. Going to ground with your opponent prevents you from making a quick getaway.
So, the tips below are all designed to incapacitate your attacker and give you the chance to escape. Let’s look at what they are.
                    </p>
                   
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12">

                    Walking home alone and feeling uneasy? Getting a weird vibe from a stranger on the bus? Many of us have been there.

In a January 2018 survey of 1,000 women nationwide, 81 percent reported experiencing some form of sexual harassment, assault, or both in their lifetime.

Verbal harassment was the most common form, but 51 percent of women said they were touched or groped in an unwelcome way, while 27 percent of women survived sexual assault.

Even if you’ve personally never felt yourself in a situation that made you feel physically unsafe, having reassurance about your next steps (and what you can do to help yourself should the unfortunate circumstance ever happen) can make all the difference.

A study from the University of Oregon found that women who participated in a self-defense class felt they:

had better safety strategies in place
were more equipped to deal with strangers, and people they know, in the context of potential assault or abuse
had more positive feelings about their bodies
had increased self-confidence
Below are our top eight self-defense moves for women — complete with instructions — to help you feel empowered to defend yourself in any situation.

                        We all have heard about Self-defense since we were children, and living in this brutal world of the 21st century where no one is completely safe, it comes as a responsibility that it is only us who can protect us.

If we see the basic definition, it is protecting oneself from any external harm by defending the opponent.

Self – defense use is under legal jurisdictions called as the “right to self – defense”. In today’s world, it is very important to know to protect yourself.

Statistics show that one in three women will be the victim of some type of violent attack in her lifetime.  In the training, it is taught to block an attack, but if one can avoid it, it is a much better case!


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hence, the training should also include preventing an attack in the first place. Which type of karate would you like to pursue to protect yourself?

Knowing something as strong as Karate gives you confidence and strength that you’re not weak and has the potential to do what they dream of.
To protect ourselves from being harmed, injured or killed is a basic right of every human being. Thus instead of becoming vulnerable and helpless, wise people learn the tactics and defend themselves. So it becomes very important for us to learn self-defense.

                <br><br></div>
                <h3>1. Commences with strength training</h3>
The workshops start with basic warm-up and flexibility exercises.
<br><br>
<h3>2. Teach basic self-defense techniques</h3>
In the workshop they teach basic punching, blocking, and kicking techniques during hostile situations. As women have different attire than men the workshop also covers up to fight in that situation keeping in mind the comfort of the dress a woman wears.
<br><br>
<h3>3. Apply those techniques to mock situations</h3>
The students are divided into batches. They use the learned techniques in mock situations. ThinkVidya is one such company which arranges such workshops for the corporate and industries for women.

                <h1>8 Self-Defense Moves Every Woman Needs to Know </h1><br><br>
                <h5>1. Hammer strike</h5>
                Using your car keys is one of the easiest ways to defend yourself. Don’t use your fingernails, because you’re more at risk to injure your hands.

Instead, if you feel unsafe while walking at night, have your keys stick out from one side of your fist for hammer strikes.
<p>To perform:

    <p>1.Hold your key ring in a tight fist, like holding a hammer, with keys extending from the side of your hand.</p>
    <p>2.Thrust downward toward your target.</p>
</p>
<br><br>
<h5>2. Groin kick</h5>
If someone is coming at you from the front, a groin kick may deliver enough force to paralyze your attacker, making your escape possible.
<p>To perform:

    <p>1.Stabilize yourself as best you can.</p>
        
        
    <p>2.Lift your dominant leg off the ground and begin to drive your knee upward..</p>
    <p>3.Extend your dominant leg, drive hips forward, slightly lean back, and kick forcefully, making contact between your lower shin or ball of your foot and the attacker’s groin area.</p>
</p>
<br><br>
<h5>3. Heel palm strike</h5>
This move can cause damage to the nose or throat. To execute, get in front of your attacker as much as is possible.

<p>To perform:</p>
<p>1.With your dominant hand, flex your wrist.</p>
<p>2.Aim for either the attacker’s nose, jabbing upward from the nostrils, or underneath the attacker’s chin, jabbing upward at the throat.</p>
<p>3.Make sure to recoil your strike. Pulling your arm back quickly will help thrust the attacker’s head up and back.</p>
<p>4.This will cause your attacker to stagger backward, allowing you to escape their grasp.</p>
<p>Alternative: An open palm to the ears can be very disorienting.</p>
<br><br>
<h5>4. Elbow strike</h5>
If your attacker is in close range and you’re unable to get enough momentum to throw a strong punch or kick, use your elbows.
<p>To Perform</p>
<p>1.If you can, stabilize yourself with a strong core and legs to ensure a powerful blow. </p>
<p>2.Bend your arm at the elbow, shift your weight forward, and strike your elbow into your attacker’s neck, jawline, chin, or temple. These are all effective targets.</p>
<p>3.This may cause your attacker to loosen their grip, allowing you to run.</p>
<br><br>
<h5>5. Alternative elbow strikes</h5>
Depending on how you’re standing when you’re initially attacked, you may be in a better position for variations on the elbow strike.
<p>To perform from the front:</p>
<p>1.Lift your elbow to shoulder height.</p>
    <p>2.Pivot on same-side foot and allow your hips to rotate, creating more momentum into the front part of your elbow when you strike.</p>

   <p> To perform from the side and back:</p>

<p>1.Make sure you see the target.</p>
<p>2.Bring your elbow up and pivot your opposite foot, rotating your hips and turning into the target, making contact with the back part of your elbow.</p>
<br><br>
<h5>6. Escape from a ‘bear hug attack’</h5>
For cases where the attacker is coming from behind, you’ll want to use this move. Focus on getting low and creating space to free yourself.
<p>To Perform:</p>
<p>1.Bend forward from the waist. This shifts your weight forward, making it more difficult for your attacker to pick you up.</p>
<p>2.Turn into the attacker with one of your elbows and continue counterattacking.</p>
<p>3.This should give you space to turn fully, using another move to injure the face or strike the groin. With the space these moves have created</p>
<br><br>
<h5>7. Escape with hands trapped</h5>
  If your attacker comes from behind and traps your arms (this is similar to a bear hug, but you won’t be able to move as freely)
  <p>To Perform:</p>
  <p>1.First reaction should be to stop your attacker’s arms from going higher into a headlock. Shift your hips to one side. </p>
  <p>2.Bring your hand back up to your arms and raise your opposite elbow to turn into the wrap. Keep your arms tight to your chest as you’re turning in.</p>
  <p>3.Stay aggressive with your knees and other counterattacks until you can disengage.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h5>8. Escape from side headlock</h5>
When the attacker locks their arm around your head from the side, your first instinct should be to avoid getting choked.
<p>To perform:</p>

<p>1.Turn into the attacker’s side as much as possible to avoid being choked.</p>
<p>2.With your hand that’s furthest away, strike the groin with open-handed slaps until you have enough mobility to turn your head all the way out to disengage.</p>
<br><br>
<h1>Some Important Thing To consider:</h1>
<h2>Focus on the vulnerable areas</h2>
Focus on your attacker’s vulnerable places: eyes, nose, throat, and groin. Aim all of the moves below at one or several of these areas to have maximum impact.

AVOID THE CHEST AND KNEES
Don’t aim for the chest, as that tends to be ineffective. Aiming for the knees requires a specific kick that can be too risky for the average person.

Use all of your force and aggression during execution. Make it known that you’re a powerful lady. Use your voice, too. Be loud to intimidate the attacker and create attention in case somebody is nearby.
<br><br>
